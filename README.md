# Javascript Pizzeria project

This week's project was all about mastering vital yet basic JavaScript concepts like variables, conditionals, and native methods. 

## The problem

The assignment was to develop a pop up dialog with the customer, for them to make an order at the Javascript pizzeria. The prompt method made it possible to present the customer with the menu and instruct them to input the meal of their choice. The alert method then informed the customer of their choice. If the input was invalid, the customer was informed, again with an alert, and instructed to start over from the beginning. log method was used to follow what happened in the consol. 

I decided to write the code using if-statements, declaring variables and giving them a value. When I was happy with my results and felt like I had grasped the concept, I moved on to refactor my code and use switch cases instead of if-statements. 

If I had more time I would have liked to try out using arrays in my code as well, as I think they give the code a cleaner look.
